💰 Why We Charge for Free Tools?
Yes — some of the tools used by NetFinesse are open-source or free.

But here’s the truth:

- We built the stack that brings them together seamlessly in Telegram
- Some APIs used in this bot are not free — we pay monthly for access
- You’re saving hours of command line setup, installs, tokens, and terminal commands
- You're paying for curation, convenience, and constant updates

You're not just paying for access to free tools —
